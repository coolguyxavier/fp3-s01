so i did a second project cause i thought this would be easier
taking my arrays task was too much work so I just -thought of one on the spot
from other modules, it takes in information, uses functions, and returns information
its organized so that each mathematical operator takes place in its own file
i think i did pretty good for only two hours, despite it being a little too simple.
